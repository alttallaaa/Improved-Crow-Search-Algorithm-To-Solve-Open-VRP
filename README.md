# Improved-Crow-Search-Algorithm-To-Solve-Open-VRP
This program solves the Open Vehicle Routing Problem (OVRP) using the Improved Crow Search Algorithm (ICSA), enhancing CSA with roulette wheel selection and inertia weight. Tested in Borland C++ on small, medium, and large datasets, results show increased iterations and population size reduce delivery costs.
